# Byzantine-Resistant Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection (NSL-KDD)

This project implements a **Federated Learning (FL)** framework for **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** using the NSL-KDD dataset. It simulates **Byzantine clients** (malicious participants) and applies the **Krum aggregation algorithm** to defend against model poisoning attacks in a decentralized training environment.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Federated Learning Simulation** with multiple clients
- 🔐 **Byzantine Attack Simulation** (sign-flip and constant update)
- 🧠 **Robust Aggregation** using the **Krum Algorithm**
- 📊 Real-time evaluation after each federated training round
- 📁 Uses **NSL-KDD**, a well-known IDS benchmark dataset
